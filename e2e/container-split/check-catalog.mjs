// check-catalog.mjs — the single source for the Check Catalog's id → metadata table (task 7.5).
//
// The design's Check Catalog (design.md: "## Check Catalog") assigns every check a stable id
// (GRANT-SHAPE-01 … RUN-REPORT-32), the layer it runs in, the requirement criteria it carries, and
// the parent property it decides (or none, for an apparatus invariant). The check-record serializer
// (serializer.mjs) builds each run report record around these fields, so they live in exactly one
// place here rather than being restated in every checks/*.spec.mjs file. A spec names its check by
// id; the serializer looks the id up here to fill `layer`, `requirements` and `property`. That is
// what keeps the emitted record's metadata equal to the catalog's rather than a per-file transcription
// that could drift from it.
//
// The `property` field mirrors the catalog column verbatim: a parent property tag ('P1', 'P5', 'P6',
// 'P12'), a phrase for the routed-path partition halves, 'setup precondition' for the Layer A
// provisioning guards, or null where the catalog records '—' (an apparatus invariant that decides no
// parent property). `requirements` is the criteria list the catalog's Req column names.
//
// NG1/NG2 hold: this is a static description of the harness's own checks. It touches no application
// code and neither container-split script.
//
// == The profile dimension (task 15.3: "every catalog id the profile selects") ==
// A run names a compose profile — `split` or `collapsed` — and NOT every check is a claim about both
// topologies. The collapsed profile runs ONE container (the `auth-surface` service under an env
// overlay) behind `proxy-collapsed`, with no `api-container` and no allowlist, so a check whose claim
// is about the RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN the two containers has no subject there, and a check whose claim
// the collapse satisfies for free would pass VACUOUSLY (Property 6: no check passes vacuously — and a
// vacuous pass is worse than an absent check, because it reads as evidence).
//
// So each entry carries the profiles that SELECT it, declaratively, here — not as a list in run.mjs or
// reporter.mjs, which is precisely the drift this module exists to prevent. `checkIdsForProfile`
// derives the run's id set from this table; the reporter accounts for exactly those ids and the run
// report's completeness rule is read against them. A check a profile does not select is NOT a skip
// record and NOT a catalog deletion: it is simply not accounted for in that run.
//
// Every entry that is not selected by both profiles carries a comment saying WHY it does not apply
// under `collapsed`. No id is renumbered or removed.

// The compose profiles a run can name (compose.harness.yml defines both). Owned here because the
// catalog's profile dimension is keyed on them and run.mjs — which imports this module — re-exports
// this array as its own `PROFILES`, so the two cannot drift.

// serializer can emit that scope rather than letting the record overclaim (task 7.5 bullet:
// "Where a check decides only part of a parent property, the record says so"). `profiles`, when
