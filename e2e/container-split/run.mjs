// run.mjs — the two-container-test-harness Layer B runner (Req 5.1, 5.5, 5.6).
//
// One documented entry command, zero interactive prompts, so the command an engineer runs locally
// (`npm run harness:container-split`) is the command CI runs. This file is authored in pieces
// across task 7: THIS commit lands 7.1 — per-run secret generation, resolved-env-file writing, the
// password-distinctness assertion, MONGO_URI validation, and the classification of setup outcomes
// as SETUP FAILURES distinct from check failures (Property 9). Later 7.x tasks add the observer
// credential and profiling (7.2), the allowlist-digest guard (7.3), teardown (7.4), the Jest
// config and check-record serializer (7.5), and the two HTTP clients (7.6).
//
// It composes existing artifacts and changes no application code, no route mount and no HTTP path
// (NG1), and it never edits either container-split script (NG2). Secrets are generated with
// crypto.randomBytes per run and written only into env/*.env, which .gitignore excludes; the
// committed env/*.env.example templates carry names and non-secret values only (Req 5.6).
//
// == Why the pieces below are pure and exported ==
// Docker bring-up cannot be exercised here (task 15 owns that). So the four things that CAN run
// without Docker — secret generation, env-file resolution, the distinctness assertion, and URI
// validation — are written as pure, independently importable functions with no Docker or process
// side effects, and are unit-tested by task 15's siblings and runnable now via `--validate`. The
// Docker-touching orchestration is quarantined in `main()` behind that flag.

// registration path and the local login strategy both require (api/server/services/AuthService.js,
// api/strategies/localStrategy.js). The Seeded_Account's password hash has to be a hash the login
// comparison accepts, so the harness uses the same library rather than a second convention

// The Check Catalog's id set — the vocabulary the early-exit report accounts for, so a run that ended

// unmentioned. The early-exit report (below) tells a backend-lane id from a Layer B one through
// layer-a-outcome.mjs's `isBackendLaneCheck`, which reads the catalog's own `layer` rather than a
// second list here.
// `checkIdsForProfile` is the profile dimension of the same table: a run accounts for the ids its
// profile selects, not every id the catalog carries (the collapsed profile runs one container, so the
// checks whose claim is about the relationship between two containers are not its to decide). The

// paths cannot disagree about what a record looks like.
// Imported under an alias. `CHECK_STATUS` is the check RECORD's status vocabulary ('pass' | 'fail' |

// application must then parse. For most keys that is harmless — isEnabled('') is false, and the
// string readers all spell `?.trim() || default`. For the keys below it is fatal at MODULE LOAD:
// packages/api/src/mcp/mcpConfig.ts reads each as `math(process.env.KEY ?? <default>)`, `??` falls
// back on null/undefined only, so '' is passed straight through to math() with NO fallbackValue;
// math()'s validator (packages/api/src/utils/math.ts) is /^[+\-\d.\s*\/%()]+$/, `+`-quantified, so
// it does not match '' and math() throws. mcpConfig.ts evaluates these at import time, so the
// throw happens before any route mounts and the container never serves.
//
// Without this guard that failure arrives as a 300-second SETUP FAILURE [bringup-timeout] naming
// an unhealthy service, with `Error: Invalid characters in string` buried in the log tail and
// nothing pointing at the env fixture that caused it. So the guard reads the fixture instead: it
// names the file, the key, and why the empty value is fatal, before any container starts.
//
// This is a FIXTURE-CORRECTNESS guard, not a general env validator. It asserts one thing about the
// harness's own generated files, over a closed key list, and it has no opinion about any other key:

//
// Two things land here, both built as pure snippet-producers so the logic is testable without a
// live mongod (the actual root `mongosh` spawn is task 15):
//
//  1. A read-only observer role + user, created by the runner's OWN root snippet — never by
//     provision.mongo.js (NG2). It grants `find` on `system.profile` and on every collection a
//     check inspects, and nothing else. It is Req 3.9's read-only credential distinct from the
//     Container_1_Grant, and it is what lets BOOT-NOWRITE-23 read the profile and GRANT-DENY-WRITE-04
//     confirm a refused write left the target unchanged, both without using either container's
//     credential to look.
//
//  2. Boot-time profiling: before the Auth_Surface starts, as root, disable profiling, drop
//     system.profile, recreate it CAPPED AT 64 MB, then set profiling to level 2 (all operations).
//     The explicit sizing is load-bearing: system.profile is capped at 1 MB by default, and a
//     read-heavy boot can roll it and discard the earliest entries — a false pass on exactly the
//     window BOOT-NOWRITE-23 cares about. 64 MB removes that failure mode (design: Boot-Write
//     Observation).
//
// NG2 is absolute here: none of this touches or is emitted by the provisioning script. NG1 holds
// too — this composes machinery around the existing image and changes no application code.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The boot-window ANCHOR collection, and why the boot-write check needs one.
//
// BOOT-NOWRITE-23 must not pass off an unusable observation (Property 6), so it asserts that the
// profile still holds the window's left edge: a capped `system.profile` that rolled discarded its
// oldest entries, and a zero count read off a rolled profile is silence mistaken for evidence. The
// original test for that was "the oldest surviving entry predates the container's start timestamp" —
// and on a real run it failed on every boot, because the profile is DROPPED AND RECREATED EMPTY
// milliseconds before that timestamp is recorded. There was nothing before the window for the oldest
// entry to be. The precondition could not hold on a healthy run, which is the definition of a broken
// check rather than a finding.
//
// So the runner writes the anchor itself: with profiling already at level 2 and before any container
// starts, it issues ONE profiled read against this collection. That read is the first entry in the
// fresh profile, and it sits before the boot window opens. The check then decides usability by the
// anchor's PRESENCE:
//
//   * anchor present  => nothing has been discarded since profiling was enabled, so the profile
//                        covers the whole window. A strictly stronger statement than "some entry
//                        predates boot start", which a partial roll can still satisfy.
//   * anchor absent   => the capped collection rolled past the window's left edge (or profiling never
//                        recorded), so the observation is unusable and the check reports that rather
//                        than a verdict — never a pass.
//
// Presence rather than a timestamp comparison is deliberate: mongod runs in a container and the
// timestamp the runner records for the window's left edge comes from the host clock, so a
// millisecond-scale comparison across the two would make the check hostage to clock skew between them.
// The anchor is a read, and it is issued by root rather than by either container, so it can never be

// The `Seeded_Account` (Req 3.16, 3.17, 3.18; task 11.5; fixture for PATH-EXERCISE-25).
//
// == Why it exists ==
// Roughly ten of the eighteen path exercises that were PASSING passed vacuously. An anonymous
// request to a session-gated path is refused at the gate ahead of the handler, so the handler issues
// no MongoDB query, so the `Exercise_Log_Window` is clean BECAUSE NOTHING WAS QUERIED — evidence
// identical to what a grant of zero collections would produce (Property 6). One seeded local account
// plus a real session is what converts those exercises into tests of the bounded-below half.
//
// == Inserted, not registered ==
// `/api/auth/register` answers 403 in the harness env (ALLOW_REGISTRATION unset), and registration is
// itself one of the paths under exercise — so registering the account would both fail and entangle the
// fixture with a path whose verdict it is meant to enable. The account is inserted directly into
// `users` with the field set the login path reads.
//
// == Under the Root_Credential, never the Container_1_Grant (Req 3.17) ==
// Seeding with the grant the checks decide on would test the grant with itself: a failed seed would be
// indistinguishable from the grant gap the checks are looking for, and a successful one would have
// assumed the answer to the `users`-write question GRANT-ALLOW-WRITE-05 is supposed to decide. The
// snippet below is appended to the harness-owned ROOT snippet, which already holds the
// `Root_Credential` for exactly this class of precondition (the observer credential, the profile
// sizing).
//
// == Outside the boot window (Req 3.18) ==
// It is the LAST step of that root snippet, which the runner applies immediately before
// `captureBootStart()` records the boot window's left edge — so the insert completes ahead of the
// window BOOT-NOWRITE-23 counts writes inside. Attribution by `user` would filter the seed out anyway
// (it is `harness_root@admin`; the check reads `librechat_auth_surface@admin`), but relying on that
// filter would make the check's correctness depend on a coincidence of credentials rather than on the
// window being clean, and not relying on it costs nothing.
//
// It is also after profiling is enabled, which gives BOOT-NOWRITE-23's usability guard a second
// profiled entry beside the anchor read rather than leaving the profile's contents to whatever the
// boot happened to do.
//
// NG1/NG2 hold: this writes one document into an existing collection through the harness's own root
// connection. No application code, route mount or HTTP path changes, and neither container-split
// script is touched.

//   * `emailVerified`  — true, so login does not divert into the verification branch and answer
//                        'Email not verified.' (no mail transport is configured in the harness).
//   * `name`/`username`— what the login response and the SPA read back; `username` is also lowercased
//                        by the schema.
//   * `role`           — the application's default user role.
//   * `avatar`         — null, exactly as `registerUser` writes it.
//   * `twoFactorEnabled` / `termsAccepted` — false, the schema defaults, spelled out because a raw

// The run report's lifecycle at BOTH ends of a run that does not reach stage 11 (Req 5.9, 5.10).
//
// reporter.mjs writes run-report.json from inside the Layer B Jest run, which is stage 11. That
// leaves two holes at either end of the sequence, and both of them produce a MISREADING rather than a
// missing file:
//
//   * At the start: a run that fails before stage 11 leaves the PREVIOUS run's report on disk,
//     untouched and undated in any way a reader notices. The next person reads an hour-old tally as
//     this run's result — which is exactly the confusion Req 5.9/5.10 exist to prevent, arriving
//     through the artifact instead of through the exit code. So the report is DELETED at run start,
//     before stage 1: after that, the file's presence means this run produced it.
//
//   * At the end: the run that failed had already decided the twelve backend-lane catalog ids at
//     stage 1 — Layer A ran, and in the observed failure it passed — and then discarded all of it,
//     because the only writer of the report lives in the stage the run never reached. So the runner
//     writes the report itself when it ends early, carrying Layer A's verdict and recording every
//     unreached Layer B id as a `skip`.
//
// Three lines are held exactly in that early report:
//
//   1. An unexecuted check NEVER reads as passed (Req 5.10). Every unreached id is `skip` with
//      SKIP_REASON.NOT_EXECUTED — the tag the catalog machinery already uses for not-executed — and
//      that reason is deliberately NOT in serializer.mjs's ENUMERATED_SKIP_REASONS, so it counts as a
//      masquerading setup failure in runOutcome rather than as a benign absence.
//   2. A setup-failure run still exits non-zero (Req 5.9). runOutcome sees a non-null setupFailure
//      AND non-enumerated skips, so `ok` is false whatever Layer A did.
//   3. The setup failure itself stays legible. It is carried as the run-level `setupFailure`, which
//      serializeRun renders as its own `SETUP FAILURE [kind]` section and records in the JSON, so a
//      report whose Layer A ids all say `pass` cannot be mistaken for a successful run: the outcome
//      line says FAIL and the failure section names what could not be brought up (Property 9 — a
//      topology that never came up falsified nothing).

// TASK 15.2 — the exec seam and the stages around it (Layer A through teardown).
//
// Everything above this line runs without Docker. Below it is the orchestration the design's "The
// Entry Command — One Invocation, Full Sequence" fixes: run Layer A, resolve the image, preflight
// the nine compose values, bring mongod up, provision, run the harness-owned root snippet, record
// the boot timestamp, bring up the containers + proxy, publish the harness context, run Layer B,
// report, and tear down. Layer A leads because it needs none of what follows it and because it is
// where a grant regression shows up; the design's "Layer A runs in the same sequence" calls that
// ordering a convenience, but a Layer A that runs after bring-up does not run at all when bring-up
// fails, which is the case the ordering exists for. Two disciplines keep it honest and testable:
//
//   * Every Docker/mongosh/jest touch goes through ONE injected `exec(command, args, opts)` that
//     resolves `{ status, stdout, stderr }`. The STAGE LOGIC — the image-resolution decision, the
//     nine-value preflight, readiness classification, the context-primitive assembly, and the
//     sequence with its SetupFailure branches — is pure over that exec, so it is unit-exercisable
//     without Docker exactly as the pure functions above are (the sibling *.test.mjs feeds a fake
//     exec), and `runHarness` below takes the exec as a parameter.
//   * A SetupFailure at any stage 1–10 ends the run non-zero and admits NO request-level check
//     (Property 9). Teardown is registered BEFORE bring-up (task 7.4) and runs from finally +
//     SIGINT/SIGTERM.

// within 300s", listing every service `ps` did not call healthy. Against a real failure that reading
// was wrong on three counts at once, and each one sent the reader somewhere unhelpful:
//
//   * It asserted an elapsed time the runner never observed. Compose aborted in about fourteen
//     seconds with `dependency failed to start: container harness-auth-surface exited (1)`; it never
//     waited the window out. "Within 300s" reads as "we gave it the full budget", which invites
//     raising a timeout that was never reached.
//   * It named the wrong failure mode. A container that EXITED has a log with a reason in it; a
//     container stuck `starting` is still running and needs a different look. Collapsing the two
//     hides which evidence to read first.
//   * It named services that had not failed. `harness-proxy` was listed as unhealthy when the proxy
//     never started at all — its dependency failed first, so compose left it `created`. A service
//     that never ran is a consequence, and listing it beside the real failure buries the one name
//     that matters.
//
// So the decision is split in two: a pure classifier (classifyBringupFailure) decides WHAT failed and
// WHICH mode from the captured compose output, and classifyBringup turns that into the SetupFailure.
// Both stay pure over already-captured strings, so every branch is exercisable without Docker.
//
// The SetupFailure SHAPE is unchanged (kind/service/detail) and Property 9 behavior is unchanged: a
// bring-up failure of either mode is a setup failure, nothing was falsified, and no request-level

// The Layer A value is a two-field summary (`{ status, selfSkipped }`), not the suite's stderr.
//
// == Why composeEnv is handed to the CHILD PROCESS and not applied by the bootstrap ==
// Several checks spawn `docker compose` themselves (TOPO-ENV-14 and MONGO-URI-19 read
// `config --format json`; the topology checks read `ps`), and compose.harness.yml interpolates its nine
// values with NO defaults, so those reads need them in the environment `docker` is spawned with.
// Their exec seams call `execFile('docker', argv, …)` with no `env`, which means the child inherits the
// REAL environment of the process that spawns it.
//
// An earlier fix tried to satisfy that from inside Jest: jest.setup.mjs read the values off the context
// bridge and assigned them to `process.env`. That cannot work, and did not. Jest gives each test
// environment a CLONE of `process` (jest-util's createProcessObject; `process.env` is a proxy over a
// per-test-file copy), while `node:child_process` is the real core module closing over the real
// `process`. So a spec's `process.env.HARNESS_IMAGE = …` lands in the sandbox copy and the docker child
// is spawned from the real environment, which never received it — `The "HARNESS_IMAGE" variable is not
// set … invalid compose project`, while the topology stood up healthy beside it. (`ps` tolerates blank
// interpolation and exits 0, which is why only the two `config` readers failed.)
//
// Putting the nine in THIS spawn's `env` puts them in the Layer B process's real environment, which is
// what every descendant — the Jest workers, and the `docker` each check spawns — inherits. No sandbox
// boundary is crossed, so there is nothing left to be defeated by one.

// Property 11: the observation plane cannot be used as an ingress).
//
// Two clients, two disjoint address spaces, and the separation is structural rather than a
// convention a check is trusted to honor:
//
//   * The INGRESS client is built with the Front_Proxy's ingress address ONLY — the sole external
//     door in the split profile — and is the only client any path-exercise or routing check may
//     use. It reads X-Harness-Upstream from each response to attribute which container served the
//     request (design: "Primary observation: a proxy-set response header"). It has no notion of a
//     container address at all, so a check cannot aim it at a container's observation port and
//     bypass the proxy: there is nothing to aim.
//
//   * The OBSERVATION client is built with the two containers' loopback-published observation
//     addresses ONLY, keyed by container name, and serves /health, /livez, /readyz reads and log
//     reads and NOTHING else. It rejects any path outside that set and any container name it was
//     not built with, so it cannot be turned into a second ingress that quietly bypasses the proxy
//     — which is exactly what would undermine Requirement 1.10 and the routing result the
//     observation plane sits beside.
//
// The base URLs are BAKED IN: neither factory accepts a base address argument, so a caller cannot
// point the ingress client at a container's observation port or point the observation client at
// the ingress. `fetch` and (for logs) `exec` are injectable so the construction, the baked-in
// URLs, the header extraction and the guardrails are all unit-exercisable WITHOUT a live server or
// Docker — the actual HTTP calls run against the live topology in task 15.
//
// NG1/NG2/NG6 hold: this adds no application code, no route mount, no HTTP path, edits neither
// container-split script, and performs no credential validation — it is a harness-local HTTP
// client that reads a proxy-set header and reaches loopback health endpoints.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
