// reporter.mjs — the Jest custom reporter that feeds the check-record serializer (task 7.5).
//
// This is the thin adapter between Jest's `jest --runInBand` output and serializer.mjs. Jest reports
// per-test results; a Layer B check IS a test, and the reporter's whole job is to map each test's
// result to a check outcome `{ status, observation? }` keyed by the check id the test declares, then
// hand the collected outcomes to serializeRun to produce the JSON artifact and the human summary.
//
// == How a spec declares its check id ==
// A checks/*.spec.mjs check names its id as a bracketed tag at the START of its title, e.g. a title
// of the form:  [BOOT-NOWRITE-23] zero write commands attributed to the Auth_Surface in the boot
// window
//
// The tag is the id the Check Catalog keys on. The reporter parses it from the title, looks it up in
// the catalog for layer/requirements/property, and derives status from Jest's result:
//
//   * passed  -> pass
//   * failed  -> fail,  observation = the assertion's failure message (what decided it)
//              -> UNLESS the message carries the undecided signal (undecided.mjs), in which case the
//                 record is a `skip` with the signal's reason: the check ran and found its OBSERVATION
//                 unusable, so it falsified nothing and must not report a verdict it did not earn. The
//                 Jest test still counts as failed, so the run's exit status stays non-zero.
//   * skipped / todo / pending -> skip, observation = a skip reason if the title carries one
//
// == Layer A's verdict arrives from the runner, it is not derived ==
// Layer A runs at stage 1, in the api workspace, in its own Jest, and decides twelve catalog ids. It
// never registers a result in THIS aggregate. The runner therefore hands its verdict over through
// HARNESS_LAYER_A_RESULT and the reporter classifies those twelve ids from it (layer-a-outcome.mjs —
// the same classifier the runner's early-exit report uses). Before that hand-off existed, the reporter
// derived all twelve as `skip / optional-dependency-absent`, so a run whose Layer A had just passed 135
// tests with `mongosh` on PATH produced an artifact stating that twelve checks did not run for want of
// `mongosh`. A false statement in the artifact is worse than a missing one.
//
// A test whose title carries no `[CHECK-ID]` tag is not a catalog check (a helper `describe` block,
// say) and is ignored rather than forced into a record it has no id for. A tag that is not a catalog
// id throws through the serializer's catalog lookup — a typo'd check id is a bug worth failing on,
// not an orphan record shipped to CI.
//
// == Absence is derived from the catalog, not announced by the spec (Req 5.10, task 14.7/15.3) ==
// A check that did not run leaves NO Jest result behind — the Layer B spec files register a live
// check only when the live gate is satisfied (HARNESS_LIVE=1 and the harness context present), so a
// non-live invocation registers nothing for that id rather than a `test.skip`. To keep the report
// complete by construction, `onRunComplete` walks the Check Catalog — specifically the ids THIS RUN'S
// PROFILE SELECTS (check-catalog.mjs: checkIdsForProfile; a collapsed run does not carry the checks
// whose claim is about two containers) — and, for every selected id that
// produced no Jest result this run, emits a `skip` record with a MACHINE-READABLE `skipReason` tag
// (task 15.3) — EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_REQUIRED for the group-sync check, OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_ABSENT for the
// Layer A suites, DECIDED_BY_REFERENCE for the recorded parity check, and NOT_EXECUTED for everything
// else. The tag is what serializer.mjs's runOutcome reads to tell a benign, enumerated absence from a
// "the run decided nothing here" skip that blocks exit 0. A vanished id is precisely how "no failures
// reported" gets misread as "everything passed" (design: "Unexecuted is not passed"), so the reporter
// derives absence from the catalog rather than trusting each spec to announce its own skip.
//
// == Why a reporter and not test assertions ==
// The design emits the records "as a JSON summary alongside the human-readable reporter output". A
// reporter sees every test's result in one place and writes one artifact for the run; doing the same
// from inside the tests would scatter the write across files and race under a shared topology. The
// heavy lifting is all in serializer.mjs (pure, unit-tested); this file only translates Jest's shape.
//
// NG1/NG2 hold: this reports on the harness's own checks and touches no application code or either
// container-split script.
