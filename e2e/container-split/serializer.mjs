// serializer.mjs — the check-record serializer (task 7.5).
//
// Every Layer B check, when it runs, produces one record in the design's shape (design.md:
// "The check record"):
//
//   { id, layer, requirements, property, status, observation }
//
// This module turns a check's raw outcome into that record and folds the per-check records into one
// run report keyed by check id. It is the reporting half of RUN-REPORT-32: the report is what the CI
// lane attaches as an artifact, and the human-readable summary is what an engineer reads.
//
// Two layers, both here and both pure:
//
//   1. buildCheckRecord — takes a check id and a raw outcome, looks the id up in the Check Catalog
//      (check-catalog.mjs) to fill `layer`, `requirements` and `property`, and returns the frozen
//      record. This is the piece the design specifies: the per-check record the run report is built
//      from, keyed by check id, distinguishing pass / fail / skip / setup-failure.
//
//   2. serializeRun — folds an array of records (plus any run-level setup/teardown failure) into the
//      JSON summary the CI lane consumes and the human-readable text a reader scans. Emitting both
//      from one function keeps the two views in agreement — they are the same records rendered twice.
//
// A Jest custom reporter (reporter.mjs) is the adapter that feeds this from a live `jest --runInBand`
// run; this module has no Jest dependency so it is unit-exercisable with synthetic outcomes (pass,
// fail, setup-failure) and reused by any non-Jest caller (the runner's own early-exit report, a
// `--validate` dry run) without dragging the runner in.
//
// NG1/NG2 hold: this serializes the harness's own check outcomes. It touches no application code and
// neither container-split script.

// `setup-failure` is the Property 9 classification — the
// topology never came up, so the check falsified nothing and must be reported distinctly from a
// `fail`. Conflating a setup failure with a check failure would let an infrastructure flake read as a
// falsified split property, which is the exact confusion run.mjs's SetupFailure class exists to
// prevent at the runner boundary and which the report must preserve here.

//
//   * EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_REQUIRED — the check is decidable only against a THIRD-PARTY SERVICE the
//                             harness deliberately does not stand up: an identity provider, a
//                             directory, any external system whose emulation would be a mock of a
//                             subsystem this harness does not own. Named generally, not per check.
//                             PATH-GROUPSYNC-26 is the current member (it asserts on the `groups`
//                             documents an Entra membership sync leaves behind). The check is RETAINED,
//                             not removed: it is a valid instrument lacking an input, and it becomes
//                             decidable the moment the harness is pointed at a real tenant.
//   * DECIDED_BY_REFERENCE  — a check decided elsewhere and recorded by reference (PARITY-SUITE-31,
//                             the existing-suite parity record; layer 'recorded').
//   * OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_ABSENT — an optional dependency was absent (mongosh for the Layer A suites).
//   * NOT_EXECUTED          — the check produced no result and no enumerated reason applies: a stage
//                             that failed, a spec that would not load, a context never published. This
//                             is NOT a benign skip — runOutcome treats it as "the run decided nothing
//                             here" and blocks exit 0 (design: "Unexecuted is not passed").
//   * OBSERVATION_UNUSABLE  — the check RAN, reached for its observation, and found the observation
//                             itself unusable: a `system.profile` that rolled past the boot window's
//                             left edge, so BOOT-NOWRITE-23 has no record of the window it must count
//                             over. Distinct from NOT_EXECUTED because the check did execute, and
//                             distinct from `fail` because nothing was falsified — a check that
//                             cannot see its property must not report a verdict it did not earn.
//
// NOT_EXECUTED and OBSERVATION_UNUSABLE are machine-readable TAGS on the same closed list as the
// others, but they are deliberately NOT in ENUMERATED_SKIP_REASONS below: an undecided check must block
// exit 0 exactly as NOT_EXECUTED does. Naming them buys a precise artifact, not a licence to go green.
//
// Two tags are REMOVED, on one reasoning: a vocabulary nothing emits only invites a future caller to
// reach for it.
//
//   * COLLAPSED_RUN_ABSENT named PARITY-COLLAPSE-29's absent collapsed run back when that check
//     compared two runs' image digests. Req 4.2 is now decided structurally from the committed
//     artifacts (design NG9), so no code path can produce the tag.
//   * OPT_IN_VARIANT named the read-only-credential boot variant, BOOT-NOWRITE-RO-24, which was the
//     only producer it ever had. That check is removed (design: it was not a definite test — a boot
//     write refused with code 13 may be SWALLOWED, leaving `/readyz` 200 and the "zero authorization
//     errors" half resting on the application having logged it, which is the very dependency
//     BOOT-CLEAN-21 already carries; BOOT-NOWRITE-23 reads `system.profile`, the database's own record
//     of issued commands, and is strictly better for the same claim). With it gone nothing produces
//     OPT_IN_VARIANT, so the tag goes with it.

//
// Adding a member here is how a check stops being required, which is a DESIGN decision rather than a
// reporting one, and nothing is added merely by naming a new tag above. The set carries three, and the
// third is such a decision, taken and recorded:
//
//   * DECIDED_BY_REFERENCE — a check decided elsewhere by reference.
//   * OPTIONAL_DEPENDENCY_ABSENT — an absent optional dependency (`mongosh` for Layer A).
//   * EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_REQUIRED — a check decidable only against a third-party service the harness
//     deliberately does not stand up. Admitted for PATH-GROUPSYNC-26: deciding it needs an identity
//     provider, standing one up would be a mock (CLAUDE.md calls heavy mocking a last resort and no
//     such double exists in this repository), and an IdP double would belong to the OIDC/Entra
//     integration's own tests, where the provider interface IS the subject. This harness's subject is
//     the split-vs-single-container topology; owning identity-provider emulation to serve one check
//     would make it own a subsystem it has no business owning — the same reasoning NG6 already applies
//     to Auth_Gate emulation. The check is retained and permanently skipped absent a real tenant, so
//     its absence is ACCOUNTED FOR rather than a gap.
//
// It replaces OPT_IN_VARIANT, which left with its only producer (BOOT-NOWRITE-RO-24); the set's size
