// checks/path-exercise.spec.mjs — PATH-EXERCISE-25 (task 11.1).
//
// Property 2, bounded-below half: the Auth_Surface's grant is *sufficient*, not merely *narrow*.
// For every path routed to the Auth_Surface, exercising that path through the Front_Proxy ingress
// completes with no authorization error. This is the half of Property 2 that is new — the grant's
// action vocabulary was narrowed to the DocumentDB-portable intersection (`find` on reads;
// `insert, update, remove, createIndex` on writes; `createCollection` granted nowhere), and nothing
// had run the application under that narrowed grant before this harness. Sufficiency was assumed,
// not observed (design.md: "The bounded-below half is the one that is new").
//
// == What "exercise" means here: ONE window scan, four outcomes ==
// Each routed path is one Caddyfile.split allowlist entry that resolves to the auth-surface upstream.
// Exercising it means issuing its recorded `Path_Payload` THROUGH THE INGRESS CLIENT — the sole client
// any path-exercise check may use (run.mjs: makeIngressClient, baked to the Front_Proxy's address,
// reads X-Harness-Upstream for attribution) — with the `Session_Fixture` attached wherever the payload
// table says the mount is session-gated, and then SCANNING THAT EXERCISE'S `Exercise_Log_Window`
// WHATEVER STATUS IT RETURNED. The scan is what decides grant sufficiency; the status only classifies
// the exercise. Three observations are available per exercise — the container the proxy attributed the
// request to, the status, and whether the window recorded an Authorization_Error — and they yield four
// outcomes:
//
//   * `understated`    — an Authorization_Error in the window, AT ANY STATUS. The check fails, naming
//                        the matched log line and the collection in it, with the recompute guidance
//                        (Req 3.4). This is the only outcome that carries that guidance.
//   * `uncorroborated` — a 5xx over a clean window: an `Uncorroborated_Server_Error` carrying the path
//                        and the status. The check fails, and the recompute guidance is WITHHELD —
//                        nothing was refused, so it is not a grant conclusion in either direction
//                        (Req 3.12).
//   * `pass`           — attributed to the Auth_Surface, non-5xx, clean window (Req 3.13).
//   * `undecided`      — an `Unconfigured_Provider` path, naming the provider. Distinct from a pass,
//                        not a failure, and it does not satisfy the "at least one pass" clause
//                        (Req 3.19, 3.20).
//
// Two observations are NOT outcomes. A window that was not scanned is a setup failure, not a verdict
// (Property 9). A session-gated path exercised with no `Session_Fixture` is a fixture failure carrying
// the path and the unattached fixture — never the `pass` that 3.13's non-5xx wording would otherwise
// hand it, because the gate refused the request, the handler queried nothing, and the exercise decided
// nothing about the grant (Req 3.22, Property 6).
//
// == Why the rule is stated as one scan rather than as a better gate order ==
// The shipped implementation applied three gates in sequence — attribution, a non-5xx status
// assertion, then the window scan — and returned at gate 2. Eight of twenty-six paths failed at gate 2
// on the live run and were reported under gate 3's meaning, *the ownership matrix understates this
// path's collection needs*: a claim about the grant drawn from a status code, with the corroborating
// scan never run. Criterion 3.4 had always named the Authorization_Error as the trigger, so the
// criterion was never weak — the gate order put the sound evidence one step past the early return. Any
// SEQUENCE can be re-broken by inserting a cheaper check ahead of the deciding one, and there is no
// ordering of gates in which a 5xx short-circuit is harmless, so path-exercise.filter.mjs splits
// COLLECTION (`observeExercise`, which always requests and always scans and classifies nothing) from
// DECISION (`classifyExercise`, which holds no client and refuses to classify an unscanned window).
// The negative-control tests below are what keep the early return out: a 5xx WITH an authorization
// error must classify `understated`, and the scan must be issued on every exercise whatever the status.
//
// == The check's own status is not "worst outcome wins" ==
// It fails on any `understated` or any `uncorroborated`, and on any exercise that produced no outcome.
// It passes only when every path is `pass` or `undecided` AND at least one path is `pass` — an
// all-`undecided` list is not a pass, for the same reason a run of nothing but `skip` records exits
// non-zero. Every path is reported with its outcome and its reason, in the check record's
// `pathOutcomes` field (path-outcomes.mjs), so `undecided` reads as the narrowed scope it is rather
// than disappearing into an aggregate green. The check-level `status` vocabulary stays
// `pass | fail | skip`, so the catalog-derived report and the exit-0 gate are untouched.
//
// == Why this loads now but exercises at task 15 ==
// The live topology exists only once run.mjs brings it up with Docker (task 15). Until then there is
// no ingress to reach and no Auth_Surface log to read, so the live check is NOT REGISTERED and the
// reporter derives PATH-EXERCISE-25's `skip` record from the catalog (task 14.7) — the file loads, is
// structurally valid, and `jest --listTests` discovers it, without standing anything up. Task 15
// populates the harness context (globalThis.__CONTAINER_SPLIT_HARNESS__: the ingress client whose fetch
// reaches the live proxy, the observation client whose exec reads live logs, the boot-window edges and
// the Seeded_Account) before invoking Jest, at which point the live check runs against the split
// topology. The decision rule, the ordering, the summary and the record shape are all authored and
// exercised here over fakes; only the live fetch and log exec are deferred.
//
// NG1/NG2/NG6 hold: this exercises the existing image through a commodity proxy and reads a proxy-set
// header and container logs. It adds no application code, no route mount and no HTTP path (NG1), edits
// neither container-split script (NG2), and performs no credential validation of any kind — the proxy
// does not emulate the Auth_Gate, so the request reaching the route is all this half decides (NG6).

// Read only by the committed-template tripwire at the bottom of this file (task 11.6), which checks
// the premise the Unconfigured_Provider carve-out rests on: the harness's own env templates configure
// no social provider. The live derivation reads the compose-resolved environment instead.
