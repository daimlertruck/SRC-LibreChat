// path-exercise.payloads.mjs — the `Path_Payload` fixture for PATH-EXERCISE-25 (task 11.4).
//
// One recorded request per exercised routed path, plus that request's expected status and one
// sentence saying why the status is the APPLICATION'S OWN answer. It lives in a non-spec sibling
// module so checks/path-exercise.spec.mjs can import it and still export nothing itself — the
// convention task 14.6 fixed, the same shape path-exercise.filter.mjs has. jest.config.mjs's
// testMatch collects `checks/**/*.spec.mjs` and `**/*.test.mjs`, so a `.payloads.mjs` is never
// collected as a test.
//
// == Why this fixture exists ==
// A live run exercised eight of twenty-six paths with NO REQUEST BODY and read the resulting 5xx as
// evidence that the ownership matrix understates those paths' collection needs. Sending nothing is
// not the neutral choice it looks like: an absent body does not test a handler on neutral input, it
// tests it on MALFORMED input, which is usually an unhandled throw, and an unhandled throw is a 5xx
// that says nothing about the grant. `/api/user/verify` is the clean demonstration — with no body
// `verifyEmail` throws on absent input and `verifyEmailController` answers 500 out of its `catch`;
// with a well-formed `{ email, token }` the SAME controller answers 400 through its
// `instanceof Error` branch, which is the application's own validation answer. The payload chooses
// which branch of one controller runs, and only one of the two is informative (Req 3.14).
//
// == The three fields, and which one is load-bearing ==
// Each entry carries `request` (method, path, query, headers, body), `expectedStatus`, and `why`.
// The third is the one that matters. Without it a future status change is absorbed as a passing
// diff; with it, changing an expected status has to be justified where it is recorded. Every `why`
// below names the middleware or controller that produces the status and the env condition it turns
// on, so the justification is checkable against the code rather than remembered.
//
// Expected statuses live HERE rather than in requirements.md deliberately: they are a property of
// the current handlers and belong where they can be revised without amending a criterion (design:
// "Per-path expected statuses are recorded alongside the payloads, in this document's companion
// fixture rather than in the requirements").
//
// == Fixed, not generated (NG8) ==
// One request per path, chosen TO REACH THE HANDLER RATHER THAN TO PROBE IT. Path exercise is
// enumeration over a small fixed domain, and sampling a domain small enough to exhaust is strictly
// weaker than exhausting it (Req 3.15). Nothing here is randomized: the one-time tokens are fixed
// hex constants, and the only values resolved per run are the Seeded_Account's credentials, which
// are a per-run SECRET rather than a generated input — they arrive through SEED_PLACEHOLDERS so the
// recorded request stays fixed and committed while no secret is committed with it.
//
// == What this fixture does NOT decide ==
// It records requests and the statuses they should produce. It does not classify an exercise
// (task 11.1's rule: `pass` / `understated` / `uncorroborated` / `undecided`), does not mint or
// attach the Session_Fixture (task 11.5), and does not derive the Unconfigured_Provider set
// (task 11.6, path-exercise.providers.mjs) — that set comes from the harness's own resolved provider
// configuration, never from a list here (Req 3.21). The `session` field records what each exercise needs attached, which
// is the one place a per-path table can say it once for all three consumers.
//
// == Verified against the handlers, not guessed ==
// Every status below was read out of the application source at the harness's env (the resolved
// env/*.env files: no ALLOW_REGISTRATION, no ALLOW_PASSWORD_RESET, no ALLOW_SOCIAL_LOGIN, no
// LDAP_URL, no EMAIL_* transport, no BAN_VIOLATIONS, ALLOW_EMAIL_LOGIN undefined). The `why`
// sentences name the file. Three findings came out of that reading and are recorded on the entries
// themselves in a `finding` field rather than smoothed over — see FINDINGS below.
//
// NG1 holds absolutely: no application code, no route mount and no HTTP path was changed to make a
// payload fit. Where a well-formed request for a routed entry cannot be expressed from outside the
// application, that is recorded as a finding to report, not treated as a licence to edit a handler.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// FINDINGS — recorded here, not fixed here.
//
//   F1. `/api/auth/ldap` IS NOT A MOUNT. api/server/routes/auth.js registers no `/ldap` route; LDAP
//       login shares the `/api/auth/login` mount, which swaps `requireLdapAuth` for
//       `requireLocalAuth` when LDAP_URL and LDAP_USER_SEARCH_BASE are both set. So the LDAP
//       surface has no request shape distinct from local login: which middleware runs is a property
//       of the container's environment, not of the request, and the harness env sets neither
//       variable. The request recorded for that entry therefore reaches `app.use('/api',
//       apiNotFound)` and answers 404 — a non-5xx that decides NOTHING about the grant, and which
//       task 11.1's rule would otherwise hand a `pass`. Reported, not patched (NG1).
//
//   F2. `/api/admin/login` and `/api/admin/oauth` ARE PREFIXES, NOT MOUNTS. api/server/routes/
//       admin/auth.js mounts `POST /login/local` and `GET /oauth/<provider>`, not `/login` or
//       `/oauth`. The recorded requests target the concrete mounts — `/api/admin/login/local` and
//       `/api/admin/oauth/openid` — which the same Caddyfile.split allowlist rules route to the
//       Auth_Surface (`/api/admin/login` plus `/api/admin/login/*`, `/api/admin/oauth` plus
//       `/api/admin/oauth/*`). That is what "chosen to reach the handler" means here, and it is why
//       `request.path` is recorded per entry instead of being assumed equal to the routed path.
//
//   F3. ONE SHARED LOGIN RATE LIMITER BOUNDS THE WHOLE EXERCISE SET. api/server/middleware/
//       limiters/loginLimiter.js is a single express-rate-limit instance keyed by client IP,
//       LOGIN_MAX=7 per LOGIN_WINDOW=5 minutes by default and unset in the harness env. It guards
//       the six `/oauth/<provider>` paths (the `/oauth` router applies it to all of them),
//       `/api/auth/login` and `/api/admin/login/local` — eight exercises — and the Session_Fixture
//       login mint is a ninth request through the same key. Past the seventh the handler never
//       runs and the answer is 429, so the recorded statuses for the LOGIN_LIMITED paths below hold
//       only while the budget does. LOGIN_LIMITED_PATHS and LOGIN_LIMIT_BUDGET export the numbers
//       so a consumer can assert the count rather than discover a 429 as a mystery outcome. The
//       remaining limiters (register, password-reset request/submit, verify, verify-resend) are
//       separate instances taking one request each and cannot bind.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

// What each exercise must carry beyond its payload. Recorded per path here so ONE table says what
// is attached to what — task 11.5 reads it to attach the Session_Fixture, task 11.1 reads it to
// decide whether Req 3.22's fixture-failure rule applies to an exercise that arrived anonymous.
//
//   NONE           — the mount sits ahead of every authentication middleware; the payload alone
//                    reaches the handler.
//   GATED          — the mount sits behind `requireJwtAuth` (middleware.requireJwtAuth in
//                    api/server/routes/auth.js). Session-gated in Req 3.16's sense, derived from the
//                    route file at implementation time rather than re-derived from the split (NG4).
//                    An exercise of one of these with no Session_Fixture attached is a FIXTURE
//                    FAILURE, never a pass (Req 3.22) — the gate answers 401 over a clean window,
//                    which is exactly the vacuous shape Property 6 excludes.
//   REFRESH_COOKIE — not behind an authentication middleware, but the handler reads the refresh
//                    cookie and answers without touching a collection when it is absent. Attaching
//                    the Session_Fixture's cookie is what makes the recorded status the handler's
