// path-exercise.session.mjs — the `Session_Fixture` for PATH-EXERCISE-25 (task 11.5, Req 3.16, 3.22).
//
// A non-spec sibling, like path-exercise.filter.mjs, path-exercise.payloads.mjs and
// path-exercise.providers.mjs: jest.config.mjs's testMatch collects only `*.spec.mjs` / `*.test.mjs`,
// so nothing here is collected as a test and the spec that imports it still exports nothing itself
// (task 14.6).
//
// == Why a session at all ==
// Roughly ten of the eighteen path exercises that were PASSING passed vacuously. An anonymous request
// to a session-gated path is refused at the gate ahead of the handler, so the handler issues no
// MongoDB query, so the `Exercise_Log_Window` is clean BECAUSE NOTHING WAS QUERIED — evidence
// identical to what a grant of zero collections would produce. That is the vacuous pass Property 6
// exists to exclude, and it is worse than a failure because it reports the grant as sufficient on
// evidence that carries no information. A real session is what converts those exercises into tests of
// the bounded-below half.
//
// == What the fixture is, and how it is obtained ==
// It is an APPLICATION session, minted by the application's own login handler:
// `POST /api/auth/login` with the `Seeded_Account`'s credentials, sent THROUGH THE INGRESS CLIENT (the
// Front_Proxy), with two things read back out of the response and nothing else —
//
//   * the refresh cookie from `set-cookie` (`refreshToken`, plus the `token_provider` marker
//     `setAuthTokens` sets beside it: api/server/services/AuthService.js), kept in a jar scoped to the
//     ingress origin;
//   * the access token from the login response BODY (`{ token, user }`:
//     api/server/controllers/auth/LoginController.js).
//
// Both are carried back on each session-gated exercise the way a browser would: the cookie as a
// `Cookie` header on the ingress origin, the token as `Authorization: Bearer`.
//
// == NOT Auth_Gate emulation (NG6) ==
// Nothing here mints, decodes, re-signs or inspects a token. The harness holds no signing key and
// performs no crypto on this path: it posts a password and copies two opaque strings back out. That is
// the same property that makes a commodity reverse proxy an adequate Front_Proxy — no credential is
// validated at the edge, and no bearer-admission or cookie-exemption rule is tested or stood in for.
// Obtaining the session through the ingress rather than by signing a JWT out of band is what keeps it
// that way, and `assertNoTokenInspection` below is the standing guard on it.
//
// == When it is minted ==
// Inside stage 11, and only after the boot window has closed. Login triggers the memoized
// `Model.createIndexes()` on `sessions`, `refreshtokenbridges` and `openidrefreshflights`, and
// BOOT-NOWRITE-23 counts write commands attributed to the Auth_Surface inside
// `[bootStart, readyAt + 60s]` — an in-window login would put a legitimate index build inside the
// count. `awaitBootWindowClosed` below is what enforces the ordering, deliberately as a property of
// THE FIXTURE rather than of Jest's file ordering: Jest picks its own file order, so a mint that
// depended on running after boot-nowrite.spec.mjs would be correct by luck. Waiting on the window's
// right edge is correct whichever file runs first. NC6 keeps the same rule honest in the other
// direction — the window is bounded by boot events, so a login inside it must not make
// BOOT-NOWRITE-23 red.
//
// == The fixture-failure signal (Req 3.22) ==
// An exercise of a session-gated path with no fixture attached is a FIXTURE FAILURE, never a pass: the
// gate refuses it with a 401 over a clean window, which is exactly the three observations criterion
// 3.13 would otherwise hand a pass to. `decideSessionAttachment` produces that signal as data so task
// 11.1's decision rule can report it, and NC8 (task 13.3) is the control that proves the bounded-below
// half cannot be satisfied by a request that queried nothing.
//
// NG1/NG2/NG4 hold: the session is obtained through an existing route with an existing request shape,
// no application code / route mount / HTTP path changes, neither container-split script is touched, and
// which paths are session-gated is read off the recorded table in path-exercise.payloads.mjs (derived
// from `middleware.requireJwtAuth` in api/server/routes/auth.js) rather than re-derived here.

// The 60-second tail past the first `/readyz` 200 that closes the boot window. Imported from the
// boot-write check's own module so the mint and BOOT-NOWRITE-23 read ONE number: a fixture that waited
// on a different tail than the check counts over would reintroduce the ordering hazard silently.
import { BOOT_WINDOW_TAIL_MS, bootWindowEnd } from './boot-nowrite.filter.mjs';
