// path-exercise.filter.mjs — the pure decision logic and constants behind this check's Layer B spec (task 14.6).
//
// The exported deciders and constants this check's spec relies on live here, in a non-spec sibling
// module, so the spec file (path-exercise.spec.mjs) can import them and export NOTHING itself. jest.config.mjs's
// testMatch collects only `*.spec.mjs` / `*.test.mjs`, so a `.filter.mjs` is never collected as a
// test — the same shape boot-nowrite.filter.mjs establishes.
//
// == THE RULE: one window scan, four classifications. Never a sequence of gates. ==
// This module previously applied three gates in sequence — attribution, then a non-5xx status
// assertion, then the `Exercise_Log_Window` scan — and RETURNED AT GATE 2. On the live run eight of
// twenty-six paths failed at gate 2 and were reported under gate 3's meaning, *the ownership matrix
// understates this path's collection needs*: a claim about the grant drawn from a status code, with the
// corroborating scan never run. Criterion 3.4 had always named the Authorization_Error as the trigger,
// so the criterion was never weak — the gate order put the sound evidence one step past the early
// return, and the evidence was already there and was unreachable.
//
// The replacement is not a better ordering, and the code is shaped so that it cannot become one:
//
//   * `observeExercise` COLLECTS. It issues the request and scans the window, unconditionally, in that
//     order, with no branch between them and no classification logic of any kind. It cannot short-
//     circuit on a status because it never asks what the status means.
//   * `classifyExercise` DECIDES. It is pure over an already-collected observation record and holds no
//     client, so it cannot skip the scan — there is nothing left to skip. It REFUSES to classify an
//     observation whose window was not scanned (throwing `WindowNotScannedError`), so an unscanned
//     window can never be absorbed as a verdict (Property 9).
//
// That split is the structural guarantee. Any *sequence* of gates can be re-broken by inserting a
// cheaper check ahead of the deciding one, and there is no ordering of gates in which a 5xx
// short-circuit is harmless — so there is no sequence here to insert one into. The status only
// CLASSIFIES an exercise; the scan is what decides grant sufficiency.
//
// NG1/NG2 hold: this decides over the harness's own artifacts and touches no application code and
// neither container-split script.
